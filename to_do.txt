- app.py is for testing, transform to a functional app >> almost done, needs optimization
- make period calculate for the entire year, currently it is 1 month ahead
- add the option to edit period dates
- add the option to delete/move events
- wrap in API
- build a frontend
- fix the add event iption, cannot add long events of non-period type, becasue the date forming is in the track period functuon, needs to be taken out and made global.
